# roster

Automate a roster for things within our team :)

To add your team, you will need to fork, and then change the "names" within the Javascript at the bottom


To add your team, fork the repo and then change the people array within the roster.js.

```
var people = ['Malcolm', 'Nathan', 'Simon', 'Dane', 'Scott', 'Zak', 'Ben'];
```

_TO:_

```
var people = ['Your', 'Names', 'Here'];
```
